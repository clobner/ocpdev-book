# Thank you
I started writing a series of blog entries **Automated Application Packaging and Distribution with OpenShift** back in January 2021, originally because I just wanted to have some notes for my day-to-day work. Then I realized that there are tons of things out there that need to be explained. People in my classes were telling me that they are overwhelmed with all the news around Kubernetes and OpenShift, so I decided to not only talk about it, but also write and blog about it. 

The positive feedback I got from readers around the world motivated me a lot to continue writing just another chapter. And then my manager asked me if it wouldn’t be great to create a book out of it. So the idea of `Getting GitOps. A Practical Platform with OpenShift, Argo CD and Tekton.` was born. 

I want to thank all those people who helped me making it possible:
- Günter Herold, my manager who started the idea
- Hubert Schweinesbein, who gave the final ok
- Markus Eisele, who helped me getting the right contacts
- Florian Heubeck, for creating the foreword
- Andrew Oram, for putting my words into proper and understandable english
- My girlfriend for her patience 
- My dad for believing in me
- The cats for helping me writing and the feed-back

Thanks a lot to all of you. Thanks for reading. And thanks a lot for all your feedback.
